## How could we avoid these problems/take opportunities?

### For Aircrafts Delays:

### For Weather Delays and Cancellations:
* Understand whether certain airports are better equipped to deal with extreme weather conditions and replicate this model at other airports.
* Determine which time frames (i.e. morning, afternoon or evening flights) are the most at risk for delays and cancellations for the month of February.
* Optimize flight departure times based on ideal time frames.
* Price February ticket sales according to cancellation and delay likelihood.

### For Airline Delays:
* Understand whether the increase in June flight delays is due to higher flight traffic.
* Determine whether crew availability is adjusted based on higher flight traffic.
